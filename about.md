title: About me

![](/images/perfil.png){:height="128px" width="128px" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"} I hold a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and a phd in structural engineering, but I rather say that I'm just an _engineer_ as I like to dive into all sorts of knowledge domains. 

I have a background in numerical/computational simulation, programming and applied mathematics and currently I'm dealing with math, numerical analysis, solid mechanics, nonlinearities, concrete-like materials and computational methods in engineering. As an enthusiast of computer science, machine learning and data science, I'm also developing new ML applications and data-driven modeling strategies in computational mechanics, structural engineering and materials engineering. I have experience in the research field (empirical/experimental and numerical testing), hydrological/environmental studies (rainfall, flow-rate and temporal series), structural analysis (fem-like formulations, mechanics of materials, continuum mechanics, concrete), statistics/data analysis (databases, data munging, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, predictive research), and also education.

I enjoy solving problems and I'm into arts and humanities -- reading (mostly literature), drawing and (listening/playing) music are my main hobbies --.
