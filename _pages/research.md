## Today and the road ahead...

As I came from civil/structural engineering, my scientific production and my background are cast by numerical analysis and applied math/physics. Nevertheless, today I’m moving towards __Machine Learning (ML), Data-Driven Modelling (DDM), Data Science (DS) & Dev__. I realized that computer science (CS) and DS are much more innovative, inventive, challenging, and fulfilling, a place where the novelty lies and where I can apply my ingenuity and analytical skills, hands-on. So I’ve been not only studying CS and DS but also – regarding my formal education – researching ways to bring DS, DDM, and ML into (civil) engineering, especially to the research of complex structures and materials.

Hence my two main research subjects today are:

- Machine Learning + Data-Driven Modelling
- (Generalized/Extended) Finite Element Method
