## Today and the road ahead...

As I came from civil/structural engineering, my scientific production and my background are cast by numerical analysis and applied math/physics. Nevertheless, I'm moving towards __Machine Learning, Data-Driven Modelling, Data Science & Dev__. I realized that the innovation and the inventiveness of computer science and data science are much more fulfilling and challeging. So I've been studying ways to bring DS and ML into (civil) engineering, especially the in research of complex structures and materials.
