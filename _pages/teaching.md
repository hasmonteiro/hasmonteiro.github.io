## Style

My didactic-pedagogical style is oriented towards __active methodologies__. We live in a dynamic, accelerated, and technological world, so innovation within the educational field is imperative. How to approach the modern classroom is something that concerns me, especially how to bring informatics and technology to the lecture room, and make everything more fluid. Among all the active strategies that exist, I enjoy and apply the following approaches to my teaching:

- Project-based learning
- Problem-based learning
- Study cases
- Flipped classroom
- Hybrid study

Nonetheless, the classical theoretical/expositive lecturing cannot be underestimated... sometimes some hard work is necessary.

## Experience

I have experience in teaching the fundamentals of the Finite Element Method to _lato sensu_ post-graduate students. But I'm also able to lead all the standard (civil) engineering curriculum, from the basic math/physics to structural design and beyond. Also, I have a strong proficiency in programming and general software use, therefore I can mentoring in other fields.

### Snippet

In the following, we have an example of a project-based exercise (MEF_TP) and a slide set with some theoretical notes (MEF_A01) that are representative of my teaching style. In the project exercise, two approaches are required: (a) a formal _by-hand_ calculation, in order to understand the _black-box_ of a typical FEA software and (b) the modeling of the problem in a commercial software to learn how to operate this type of tool and check the results from (a).

## Mentoring and evaluation boards

From my Ph.D. project, an official funding application and some additional research came to life, and I ended up helping master and undergraduate students in their investigations.

Also, I took part in evaluation boards of master and undergrad. theses, as well as other judgment committees.
