I"Þ<h2 id="style">Style</h2>

<p>My didactic-pedagogical style is oriented by <strong>active methodologies</strong>. We live in a dynamic, accelerated, and technological world, so innovation within the educational field is imperative. How to approach the modern classroom is something that really concerns me, especially how to bring informatics and technology to the lecture room, and make everything more fluid. Among all the active strategies that exists, I personally enjoy and apply the following approaches to my teaching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project-based learning</li>
  <li>Problem-based learning</li>
  <li>Study cases</li>
  <li>Flipped classroom</li>
  <li>Hybrid study</li>
</ul>

<p>Nonetheless, the classical theoretical/expositive lecturing cannot be underestimatedâ€¦ sometimes some hard work is necessary.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>I have experience in teaching the fundamentals of the Finite Element Method to <em>lato sensu</em> post-graduate estudents. But Iâ€™m also able to lead all the standard (civil) engineering curriculum, from the basic math/physics to strucutural design and beyond. Also I have a strong proficiency in programming and general software use, therefore I can mentoring in other fields.</p>
