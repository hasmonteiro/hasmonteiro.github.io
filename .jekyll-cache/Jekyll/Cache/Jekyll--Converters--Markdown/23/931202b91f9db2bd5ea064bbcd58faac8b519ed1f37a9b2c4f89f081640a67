I"s<p><img src="/images/perfil.png" alt="" height="128px" width="128px" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;" /> I hold a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering and a phd in structural engineering, but I rather say that I’m just an <em>engineer</em> as I like to dive into all sorts of knowledge domains.</p>

<p>I have a background in numerical/computational simulation, programming and applied mathematics and currently I’m dealing with math, numerical analysis, solid mechanics, nonlinearities, concrete-like materials and computational methods in engineering. As an enthusiast of computer science, machine learning and data science, I’m also developing new ML applications and data-driven modeling strategies in computational mechanics, structural engineering and materials engineering. I have experience in the research field (empirical/experimental and numerical testing), hydrological/environmental studies (rainfall, flow-rate and temporal series), structural analysis (fem-like formulations, mechanics of materials, continuum mechanics, concrete), statistics/data analysis (databases, data munging, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, predictive research), and also education.</p>

<p>I enjoy solving problems and I’m into arts and humanities – reading (mostly literature), drawing and (listening/playing) music are my main hobbies –.</p>
